# Assess Critical Failure Risks

## Purpose

Evaluate AI agent project against the 6 critical failure patterns that kill 95% of projects. Identify red flags early and course-correct.

## The 6 Critical Failure Patterns

### 1. Technology-First Trap (95% Failure Rate)

**Symptoms:**

- Team exploring LangChain, CrewAI, or RAG before defining use cases
- Conversations start with "We want to use..." instead of "Users struggle with..."
- Technology enthusiasm precedes problem validation
- Building frameworks before identifying problems

**Assessment Questions:**

1. Did you define user problem before selecting technology?
2. Can you describe the user workflow that's broken without using AI/tech words?
3. Have you talked to actual users about their pain points?

**Red Flag If:** Technology discussions happened before user problem validation

---

### 2. Capability Reality Gap

**Symptoms:**

- Assuming AI can autonomously handle complex multi-step workflows
- Expecting human-level reasoning and decision-making
- Not accounting for current AI limitations
- Plans assume 100% task completion rates

**Assessment Questions:**

1. Do you know that current best AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) completes only 24% of office tasks?
2. Have you scoped agent capabilities to what AI can reliably do today?
3. Have you tested with real AI models, or are assumptions based on marketing?

**Red Flag If:** Expectations exceed current AI capabilities (24% task completion reality)

---

### 3. Leadership Vacuum

**Symptoms:**

- No executive sponsorship
- Project driven by individual enthusiasts
- No top-down strategy or vision
- Fragmented initiatives across organization

**Assessment Questions:**

1. Do you have CEO or C-level sponsorship?
2. Is AI agent development part of official company strategy?
3. Who owns this initiative at executive level?

**Red Flag If:** Only 30% of companies have CEO buy-in, despite 70% saying AI is important

---

### 4. Security and Governance Barriers

**Symptoms:**

- "We'll add security later"
- No governance policies defined
- Unclear compliance requirements
- Missing audit trails or boundary controls
- 80% experienced agents acting outside intended boundaries

**Assessment Questions:**

1. Have you identified applicable compliance regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)?
2. Do you have governance policies for agent behavior?
3. Is security architecture designed (not deferred)?
4. Are audit logging and monitoring planned?

**Red Flag If:** 92% say governance is essential, but only 44% have policies. Don't be the 48%.

---

### 5. Infrastructure Chaos

**Symptoms:**

- Managing three separate databases (application, vector, memory)
- Fragmented data architecture
- Complex infrastructure slowing development
- High operational overhead

**Assessment Questions:**

1. Are you using a unified platform for app + vector + memory data?
2. Or managing three separate databases?
3. How much operational overhead does your infrastructure create?

**Red Flag If:** Three-database setup - this kills project momentum

---

### 6. ROI Mirage

**Symptoms:**

- No clear business value metrics
- Measuring activity (agents deployed) instead of outcomes (business value)
- Can't articulate ROI
- Impressive demos without business impact
- 80% of companies report no material earnings from gen AI

**Assessment Questions:**

1. What business outcome improves? How do you measure it?
2. What's the current baseline? What's the target?
3. Can you calculate ROI: (Value - Cost) / Cost?
4. Are you measuring outcomes or just activity?

**Red Flag If:** Can't clearly articulate business value or calculate ROI

## Failure Risk Assessment

For each pattern, score:

- ‚úÖ **GREEN (0 points):** Addressed and validated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **YELLOW (1 point):** Partially addressed, needs work
- üö® **RED (2 points):** Not addressed, major risk

| Failure Pattern           | Score           | Notes       |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 1. Technology-First Trap  | {{score_1}}     | {{notes_1}} |
| 2. Capability Reality Gap | {{score_2}}     | {{notes_2}} |
| 3. Leadership Vacuum      | {{score_3}}     | {{notes_3}} |
| 4. Security & Governance  | {{score_4}}     | {{notes_4}} |
| 5. Infrastructure Chaos   | {{score_5}}     | {{notes_5}} |
| 6. ROI Mirage             | {{score_6}}     | {{notes_6}} |
| **TOTAL RISK SCORE**      | {{total_score}} |             |

## Risk Level Interpretation

- **0-2 points (GREEN):** Low risk - proceed with confidence
- **3-5 points (YELLOW):** Medium risk - address gaps before scaling
- **6-8 points (ORANGE):** High risk - course-correct immediately
- **9-12 points (RED):** Critical risk - fundamental issues, likely to fail

## Remediation Plan

For each RED or YELLOW item, define action plan:

### Pattern 1: Technology-First

**Actions:** {{remediation_1}}

### Pattern 2: Capability Gap

**Actions:** {{remediation_2}}

### Pattern 3: Leadership

**Actions:** {{remediation_3}}

### Pattern 4: Security/Governance

**Actions:** {{remediation_4}}

### Pattern 5: Infrastructure

**Actions:** {{remediation_5}}

### Pattern 6: ROI

**Actions:** {{remediation_6}}

## Decision Gate

**If Total Risk Score ‚â• 6:** STOP. Address critical gaps before proceeding.

**If Total Risk Score 3-5:** Proceed with caution. Create mitigation plan.

**If Total Risk Score ‚â§ 2:** Proceed. You're following best practices.

---

## Remember the Statistics

- **95%** failure rate when technology-first
- **80%** no material business earnings from gen AI
- **25%** achieve transformative results by being problem-first
- **56%** stopped by security/governance barriers
- **30%** have CEO sponsorship (critical success factor)

**Your goal: Be in the successful 25%, not the failing 75%.**

## Next Steps

Based on risk assessment:

1. If HIGH risk ‚Üí Fix fundamental issues before continuing
2. If MEDIUM risk ‚Üí Address gaps, then proceed
3. If LOW risk ‚Üí Continue to POC Canvas or Production Canvas

Only build agents worth keeping.
