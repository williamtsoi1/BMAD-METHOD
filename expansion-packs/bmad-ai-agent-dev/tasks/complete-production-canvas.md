# Complete Production Canvas

## Purpose

Guide validated POCs to production deployment using the 11-square Production Canvas. Transform "it works" into "it works reliably at scale."

## Prerequisites

**CRITICAL - Do NOT proceed without:**

- [ ] POC Canvas completed (8 squares) ✅
- [ ] POC built and tested with real users ✅
- [ ] At least 10-20 users validated POC works ✅
- [ ] Clear business value demonstrated ✅
- [ ] ROI calculated and positive ✅
- [ ] Users prefer agent over current solutions ✅
- [ ] Economics viable at 10x and 100x scale ✅

**If ANY box unchecked:** STOP. Return to POC validation. Do NOT scale unvalidated agents.

## The Production Canvas Flow

```
From "It Works" → "It Works at Scale"

Phase 1: Product and Scale Planning (Squares 1-2)
Phase 2: Agent Architecture (Squares 3-4)
Phase 3: Data Infrastructure (Squares 5-6)
Phase 4: Model Operations (Squares 7-8)
Phase 5: Hardening and Operations (Squares 9-11)
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Load the Production Canvas Template

Execute the create-doc task with the Production Canvas template:

```
Run task: create-doc.md with template: production-canvas-tmpl.yaml
```

This will guide you through all 11 squares systematically.

### Step 2: Complete Phase 1 - Product and Scale Planning

Work with **Production Architect** and **ROI Analyst** for Squares 1-2:

**Square 1: Business Case & Scale Planning**

- Document POC validation results
- Define ongoing success metrics (outcomes, not activity)
- Project scale: users at launch, 6 months, 1 year
- Articulate growth strategy
- Calculate comprehensive ROI

**Critical:** Only scale what users actually validated they want.

**Square 2: Production Requirements & Constraints**

- Define SLAs (response time, availability, throughput)
- Establish recovery time objectives and failover requirements
- Set cost limits and optimization targets
- Identify all compliance and data protection requirements

**Validation Gate:**

- [ ] POC results documented with evidence

⚠️ **Address checklist gaps before deploying**

- Security and governance cannot be skipped
- Complete all items
- Get required sign-offs

**If Production Canvas incomplete:**
🚨 **Do NOT deploy**

- Complete all 11 squares
- Get expert validation
- Run production readiness checklist

## Post-Deployment

### Week 1: Intensive Monitoring

- Daily user feedback review
- Incident response ready
- Quick iteration on issues

### Month 1: Stability and Adoption

- Weekly metric reviews
- User adoption tracking
- Cost optimization
- Feature refinement based on feedback

### Ongoing: Continuous Improvement

- Regular governance reviews
- Quarterly security assessments

- User feedback drives roadmap
- A/B testing for improvements

## Success Metrics (Post-Production)

### Track Business Outcomes (Not Activity)

**❌ Don't Measure:**

- Number of agents deployed
- API calls made
- Users who tried once

**✅ Do Measure:**

- Active users (weekly/monthly)
- Usage frequency per user
- Time saved at scale
- Error reduction percentage
- Revenue impact / cost reduction
- Customer satisfaction
- Employee retention (if internal tool)

### ROI Validation

Calculate monthly:

```
Actual ROI = (Value Delivered - Total Cost) / Total Cost × 100%

Compare to projected ROI from Square 1
```

**If Actual ROI < Projected ROI:** Investigate and optimize.

## When to Scale Further

Only increase scale when:

- ✅ Current users demonstrating high value
- ✅ Adoption growing organically
- ✅ Economics remain positive
- ✅ Infrastructure stable
- ✅ Security and compliance maintained

## When to Sunset

Consider retiring agent if:

- ❌ Adoption declining despite improvements
- ❌ Economics no longer viable
- ❌ Better solutions available
- ❌ Business needs changed
- ❌ Maintenance burden exceeds value

**Don't be afraid to sunset agents that don't deliver value.**

## Critical Statistics

- **25%** of companies achieve transformative results (systematic approach)
- **80%** see no material earnings (lack of focus on business value)
- **56%** stopped by security/governance (addressed in Phase 5)
- **Moderna:** 750+ agents deployed successfully (CEO sponsorship + canvas approach)

## Success Pattern

**You will know you succeeded when:**

- Agents deliver measurable business value at scale
- Users prefer your agent over alternatives
- Economics are positive and improving
- Security and compliance maintained
- Continuous improvement operational
- Team can manage and evolve agents

**Be like Moderna: Systematic approach to transformative results.**
