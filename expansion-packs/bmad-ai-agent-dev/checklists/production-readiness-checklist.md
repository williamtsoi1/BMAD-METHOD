## Critical Statistics to Remember

- ✅ **Only 25%** of companies achieve transformative results (be one of them)
- ❌ **95%** fail when technology-first
- ❌ **80%** see no material earnings from gen AI
- ❌ **56%** stopped by security/governance barriers
- ❌ **92%** say governance essential, but only **44%** have policies

## Final Validation

### Overall Readiness Score

Count your checkboxes:

- **Total checkboxes:** 90+
- **Your completed:** \_\_\_
- **Percentage:** \_\_\_\_%

**Deployment Criteria:**

- ✅ **100%:** Deploy with confidence
- ⚠️ **90-99%:** Address gaps before deploying
- 🚨 **<90%:** Not production-ready - complete remaining items

### Sign-Off Required

Before deployment, obtain sign-off from:

- [ ] Engineering Lead (Architecture and implementation)
- [ ] Security Officer (Security and compliance)
- [ ] Product Owner (Business value and user validation)
- [ ] Executive Sponsor (Strategic alignment and investment)
- [ ] Legal/Compliance (Regulatory requirements)

## Deployment Decision

**Date:** ******\_\_\_******

**Decision:** [ ] DEPLOY [ ] DEFER (complete gaps) [ ] CANCEL (not viable)

**Sign-Off:**

- Engineering: ******\_\_\_******
- Security: ******\_\_\_******
- Product: ******\_\_\_******
- Executive: ******\_\_\_******
- Legal/Compliance: ******\_\_\_******
