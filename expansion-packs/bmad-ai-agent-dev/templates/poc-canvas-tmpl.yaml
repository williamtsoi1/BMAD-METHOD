      # POC Canvas: AI Agent Validation

      ## Introduction

      This POC Canvas guides you through systematic validation of your AI agent concept using the **Product → Agent → Data → Model** flow. Complete all 8 squares before building.

      **Critical**: 95% of AI agent projects fail because they start with technology, not user problems. This canvas prevents that trap.

  - title: "PHASE 2: AGENT DESIGN"
    prompt: |
      Guide through Squares 3-4 to design agent capabilities and behavior.
      Remember: Current AI completes only 24% of office tasks. Scope appropriately.

      {{error_handling}}

      [[LLM: Design conversation flow for user success. Define tone (professional, friendly, concise, etc.). Specify session vs. long-term memory needs.]]

  - title: "PHASE 3: DATA REQUIREMENTS"
    prompt: |
      Guide through Squares 5-6 to plan data requirements and collection.
      Data needs flow from agent capabilities, not vice versa.

    content: |
      ---

      ## PHASE 3: DATA REQUIREMENTS

      ### Square 5: Knowledge Requirements & Sources

      **What information must the agent have to complete tasks?**

      {{required_knowledge}}

      **Where does this knowledge currently exist?**

      {{knowledge_sources}}

      **How often does this information change?**

      {{update_frequency}}

      **What accuracy level is needed?**

      {{quality_requirements}}

      [[LLM: Map each agent capability to required knowledge. Identify authoritative sources. Define quality standards.]]

      ---

      ### Square 6: Data Collection & Enhancement Strategy

      **How will initial data be gathered and prepared?**

      {{collection_methodology}}

      **What data has the biggest impact on agent performance?**

      {{high_impact_data}}

      **How will user interactions improve the data?**

      {{feedback_loops}}

      **How will data be ingested and kept fresh?**

      {{update_strategy}}

      [[LLM: Design data collection pipeline. Plan for continuous improvement from user feedback. Ensure update strategy maintains quality.]]

  - title: "PHASE 4: EXTERNAL MODEL INTEGRATION"
    prompt: |
      Guide through Squares 7-8 for model selection and API integration.
      Model selection comes LAST, after Product → Agent → Data.

      ---

      ## PHASE 4: EXTERNAL MODEL INTEGRATION

      ## POC VALIDATION GATE

      Before proceeding to build POC, confirm:

      - [ ] Real users validated the problem exists (Square 1)
      - [ ] User interaction model is clear (Square 2)
      - [ ] Agent capabilities are scoped to AI limitations (Square 3)
      - [ ] Conversation design and memory requirements defined (Square 4)
      - [ ] Knowledge requirements mapped to sources (Square 5)
      - [ ] Data collection strategy established (Square 6)
      - [ ] Model providers selected with cost analysis (Square 7)
      - [ ] API integration architecture designed (Square 8)

      **Next Step:** Build POC, test with real users, gather feedback.

      **Only scale what users validate they want.**

      ---

      ## Critical Reminders

      - Start with problems, not technology
      - Validate before scaling
      - Current AI: 24% office task completion rate
      - Economics must work at scale
      - Focus on user outcomes, not technical sophistication

      **Your goal: Agents that deliver business value, not impressive demos.**
